# Split Webpack Boilerplate

A webpack boilerplate with separate development and production configurations
and no repeated code.

If you want to know exactly how the boilerplate code was put together, please
read my [blog
post](https://alexthorne.io/2017/12/10/webpack-boilerplate-from-scratch/) about
it.
